## Project Overview

This project aims to recreate every artwork panel from the original Beneath a Steel Sky comic and voiceover from the game intro.
(The game intro uses the Comic Book Panels as visuals)

Each panel will all be a unique art creation by one or more different contributor(s).

> Preferably I'd like each panel in multiple layers, for example, background by itself, characters by themselves etc, so i can add a little parallax to each scene for a more engaging and entertaining look than just flat still-images

## But there's a Twist!
Do you think you‚Äôre a master artist who never makes mistakes?
Or a voice-over pro with perfect vocal control?  
**UNO Reverse Card!** 
That‚Äôs exactly what I'm *not* looking for.

This project is all about embracing a  challenge and celebrating charming human imperfections while burning an effigy of AI at the stake.

I want contributors who feel out of their depth, people who think, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt draw‚Äù or ‚ÄúMy voice is terrible.‚Äù 
That‚Äôs the magic soup I'm after!


## How It Works

### Script/Dialogue:
I have hastily re-written the script for the introduction as a sort of baseline, I'm happy with some parts, but many changes are needes.

So if you have an idea/suggestion/alteration/replacement/etc to the script, please create an issue marked "Script suggestion for scene## - by [your username]. 
(Replace "scene" with [Voicerole] or [Rewrite] if you are rewriting all of a voice role's dialogue or if you are rewriting the entire script.

Let's focus on starting with finalizing the script so we can lock it down for voiceover work.


### Artworks:
 
‚Ä¢ Check the Artwork Overview and Issues tab and find a unassigned panel you *don't* want to recreate, or one that feels more intimidating to do.

‚Ä¢ Assign the work yourself by opening an issue and marking it: Scene## - [panel name] - Assigned to: [Your Username].
use the Issue thread to keep us updated.
   
‚Ä¢ Recreate the panel in your own style: hand sketch, digital doodle, collage, pixel art‚Äîanything goes, but I'll prefer color over b/w (except for that one b/w panel).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are recreating a panel Layer (Character/Background) instead of a full panel, be sure to mark the issue title with "Layer:[The layer you chose]" after [panel name]

> [!NOTE]
> If you are drawing on paper or other physical media, please scan the drawing if possible vs using your phone/scanning app, so accurate aspect ratio is kept.
> scans and digital drawings of big artwork must be presented in a minimum of 1440p or upwards
> (The size of the artwork must fit 1-1 (without scaling/resizing etc) if imported to an image/video that has a minimum resolution of 2560 pixels wide and 1440 pixels tall, larger resolutions is fine.)

### Voiceover:

> [!WARNING]
> Scripts/ Voice lines can be subject to change until script is locked down.
> Any voice lines recorded before script lockdown can end up unusable.
> To avoid re-recording or recording unusable voiceover, please make sure Script is locked down / Finalized before starting.
> Until then. Dialogue can be changed sporadically.

‚Ä¢ Check the Voice Overview and Issues tab and find a unassigned Voice Role you *don't* want to recreate, or one that feels more intimidating to do.

‚Ä¢ Assign the work yourself by opening an issue and marking it: Scene## - [Voiceover Role] - Assigned to: [Your Username].
use the Issue thread to keep us updated.

‚Ä¢ Record the voice-over using the appropriate dialogue script. Ham it up like Gary Owens on CRACK‚Ñ¢ Cocaine, channel your inner Tiny Tim, go nuts!

Also, even though all voiceroles are technically male, anyone can contribute! 
I don't care what shoesize you wear or how many wrinkles you have on the the tip of your elbow joint, if you're a green fart monster in an abandoned military underground facility or even if you are able to reproduce speech with doing the "underarm fart pump) as long as you can make it more or less understandable in english, go for it! 

> [!TIP]
> Try to avoid going for the following "voices listed below!

‚Ä¢ "Growling/Mumbling" type (think Scooby doo for an example of both)
> -# ...That is, unless you have a natural voice that's closer to being or is high pitched/tenor/soprano. (think Mickey Mouse)
> -# ...or you have a naturally "soft/round/smooth" sounding voice that isn't as harsh/gratingsounding. (think Mickey Mouse impersonating Scooby Doo)
<details> The main reason for this one, is to make sure that voices don't end up being hard to understand, or worst case, ending up with voiceovers like the official Norwegian voice for Donald Duck i grew up with... (think of the classic Donald Duck Cartoons with the original american voiceactor trying to sound like a duck, now imagine that friend or similar you know that could almost do a passing impersonation of that voice, now imagine them doing the impersonation, but after having undergone several heavy and rigorous lobotomy sessions...
yeah, it was a little worse and less understandable than that! </details>

‚Ä¢ "Back of the throat/Gumby/village idiot/mocking" type voice. (think of *any* tv show or movie where someone impersonates someone stupid or similar)
The reason being that it's just so extremely overused and frankly unfunny.

‚Ä¢ "Trying too hard" or "celebrity impersonation" type voices...
<details> well, its hard to define trying to hard, but i guess one example might be forcing a french accent, and hanging on "the funny sounds" (like saying "Frrrrrrrrrrench" while excessively accentuating the R sound), stuff like that.
and celebrity impersonations just won't really work for this project </details>

These are not set in stone however, if you think you can make it work anyway, or that we will find it hilarious, or just want to do it for the luls, do feel free to give it a try, but no promises it will be included.



## Which Panel / Voiceover Should You Pick?
### Find the one that fits you best:

‚óè You‚Äôre really good at drawing or voice acting
<details>
‚Ä¢ Try drawing with your non-dominant hand or even with your feet.  
‚Ä¢ If your natural voice is bass or tenor, record at the opposite extreme‚Äîthe highest or lowest pitch you can manage.
</details>


‚óè You‚Äôre great at drawing some [Specific things] but can‚Äôt draw backgrounds, characters, or you csn voice act but can‚Äôt nail a certain voice or struggle accents
<details>
- Fantastic! Tackle the backgrounds, characters, or that tricky accent you‚Äôve been avoiding. </details>

‚óè You can‚Äôt draw at all, struggle with English, or think your voice sounds awful.
<details>
- *Please* draw the front cover or a full-page artwork.  
- *Please* voice the main lead.  </details>
