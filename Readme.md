# ü§î What is this all about? 
This is a collaborative, open-source effort to reimagine the gritty, dystopian opening sequence through **artwork**, **voice acting**, and **creative reinterpretation**. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned illustrator, a voice actor with a home mic, or someone who‚Äôs never drawn a line or recorded a word ‚Äî you belong here!


## üß† ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm Not Creative‚Ä¶‚Äù

This project is **especially** for people who think they‚Äôre ‚Äúnot creative,‚Äù ‚Äúcan‚Äôt draw,‚Äù ‚Äúdon‚Äôt have a good voice,‚Äù or ‚Äúwould just mess it up.‚Äù If you‚Äôve ever felt that way ‚Äî congratulations, you‚Äôre exactly who we want.

üñç Can‚Äôt draw? try drawing anyway, physically on paper or digitally on Microsoft Paint or similar
üéô Can‚Äôt voice act? Read a line in your own voice. Use your phone mic, just please avoid recording in noisy environments if possible.
‚ùìÔ∏è Not sure what to contribute? Even feedback, ideas, or jokes help shape the tone.
üö´üÜîÔ∏è Want to contribute but don't want any name credits? no problem, mark it as an anonymous contribution, submit with an anonymous account, or contact me on discord directly (i will keep your username confidential) or relayed through someone you trust.

>[!TIP]
>While we welcome any skill level or lack thereof, don't feel intimidated or think something like *"I could never do anything half as good as that anyway, so why even try?"*, give it your best shot anyway, just have fun with it.

If you need a little extra help/guidance, The absolutely amazing Chameleon_Cat has ***very*** kindly provided us with some amazing artwork guidelines for how the panels are structured to help with drawing, [AVAILABLE HERE]()




Creativity isn‚Äôt a skill ‚Äî it‚Äôs a spirit. And this project thrives on **spirit** (and other substancesüòé).

## ‚úÖÔ∏è How to Join

Open a discussion thread for each work detailing the scene number or character voiceover you want to do in the title so it's easy to see what's being currently worked on.
You can use the thread for a public worklog or notepad or whatever you want, it's your playground of you wish to use it. 
>[!NOTE]
>anything posted in the discussions forumis public and can be viewed by anyone accessing the github. (though i suspect that will mostly be SQH Discord denizens)


## üõÇ Contribution Rules

>[!NOTE]
>Feel free to interpret the artwork and voiceover however you see fit, as long as you follow these simple rules:

- **‚õîÔ∏è Absolutely NO AI or generative use!**
  no image generators, no text to speech, only non-machine-made contributions will be accepted. 

- **üîû No 18+ NSFW content**  
  That means no nudity, ultra-violence, realistic gore, or excessive swearing. Let‚Äôs keep it *somewhat* family-friendly. Cartoonish violence (think Tom & Jerry) is totally fine.

- **üßµ Use the Discussion Forum**  
  For *each and every* artwork or character voiceover you want to contribute, create a new thread in the Discussions tab. Title it with the **Scene Number** and **Scene / Character Name** so we can keep things organized.

- **üîÅ Duplicates Are Allowed**  
  Multiple versions of the same scene or character are welcome! But please prioritize any **unstarted** ones first ‚Äî we want full coverage before remixing.

- **:) No "low-effort" work**
  Simply said, please no 1 minute stickman drawing etc. take your time crafting the best you can do, dont worry about any skill or lack of it, just give it an honest try.

- **üîÜüîÖAvoid doing multiple artworks/character voiceovers at the same time**
  Please finish a contribution before starting the next

- **üéâ Having Fun Is Mandatory**  
  Seriously. If you‚Äôre not having fun, you‚Äôre doing it wrong. This is a playground.


# üé®Style, üë§Character/üó∫Place names and Lore

## üé®Style:

While you are free to use your own style and ideas, please make sure that it doesn't deviate too much from the reference material.
For example, don't kill off a major character or go completely off script, etc.

Since this is a community effort and the ultimate goal (if enough people join in) is to have all the panels and voiceovers each created by different individuals/sentient entities, a major deviation might not work with 
others creations.
(though if you have a very good/funny idea for a major deviation/change, make a suggestion explaining your idea, and how it can be incorporated/modified to fit in with the rest of the comic, and then, depending on how far the project has come etc, it will be taken onto consideration and put to a vote.)

## üë§Characters/üó∫Places:
>[!NOTE]
>These are all open for suggestions.

These are presented as Original Name / New Name suggestion

### Robert Foster / Squiston [Any other suggestions?] (Tampax) Pampers.
(I originally renamed foster to Tampax as i thought using a "intimate hygiene/protection" brand name was funnier than a beer brand, though after seeing Vohaul wearing Pampers in the comic book shown in SQH's Space Quest 2-6 Big-Boxes video at 04:08, i thought renaming him "Pampers" would be a fun nod towards that as well)

Should we make SQH be "Squiston Pampers"?

### Old Man / Old Fart
Just what i could think of while blazing through the rewrite üòÖ

### Reich / Wichser
Wichser is (as far as google translate informs me) basically the German word for "Wanker", which i think fits the character and it sounded like it could be a name. (also, (to me at least) the name Reich just seems a bit too blatant for the whole "Gnat-Z" reference)

### Joey / Soupey
**S**arcastic **O**perating **U**nit **P**rototype/**P**rocessor 
it's also referencing the "Soup's on" meme, and also thought it would be funny if he was built from a "Rotten Tomato‚Ñ¢" brand soup can (KQ6 reference)

### Henchmen
Aren't mentioned by name in the story, so they are just numbered instead.

### The Gap / The Gash
a Gash in this context is defined as a trench resembling a furrow that was made by erosion or excavation.
(I used Gash because its short and similar, but mainly because i really liked SQH's description of Officer Lizardeyes Morales in PQ3; "just standing there, scratching her gash")


## üìöLore
(original character names used for this section, atleast until names are final)

>[!NOTE]
>The story follows the original pretty closely, but has been rewritten to add some jokes and some minor changes to characters,
> like how the original presents foster as discovering new talents, but the rewrite portrays him otherwise (like he says he discovered talents like whistling, then proceeds to very badly whistle).

This lore is written linearly by time instead of a flashback in the middle.

## The Past.

### Beginning
Robert was born, stuff happened, then, on his 12th birthday, on a routine flight to the City, Robert, (always being an annoyingly curious kid) got to sit in the pilot seat of the copter since it was his birthday, and after some inappropriate questions from the pilot, Robert managed to press the button to kill the engines, the pilots scrambled, but unable to restart the engines in time, the copter crashed. 
Grabbing his rotten tomato plushie, he managed to crawl from the burning wreck.

### The story starts
The Old Man and two other villagers having followed the noise of the crash and smoke from the wreck, appear on a hilltop where he spots Robert next to the wrecked copter.

After exclaiming that Robert can't park his vehicle there, they greet him and welcomes him to the Gash, while putting band-aids on the scratches and blowing on the owie-owie-boo-boos, the Old Man bluntly tells him that the others are probably dead, and that the wreck might explode at any moment (or something.)
(Is it too dark to have voices coming from the wreck going "I'm not dead, I'm actually un-hurt, I'm just stuck" while the Old Man just loudly says "Yup, no one could have survived that crash, and its too dangerous to check" or something? (I'm thinking along the lines of the Monty Python "Bring out your dead" sketch from The Holy Grail movie :p)

### Growing up montage
The Old Man adopts young Robert, and through a montage we see how Robert grows up and learns how to spit and swear and search the city's trash&sewage dump for useful stuff and something called "Attareeg-Ayms", we also see Robert discovering new talents like taking a "**S**arcastic **O**perating **U**nit **P**rototype/**P**rocessor board" and shoving it into a soupcan robot and somehow make it work, and whistling (i will hold a seperate audition for whistle contributions (and maybe some other background noises) over on Discord.
Robert is given the nickname/surname "Foster" by the old man who had just picked up some random piece of trash and managed to read the product/brand name by the same name (for those not in "the know", Fosters is a famous Australian beer brand.)

## Present day

### Ayahuasca night at the campfire
High as a kite, the Old Man sees visions in the fire of an approaching Evil (AI?)
Robert humors him, but gets pointed out as being the thing the evil wants.
Joey indicates that there is a sound approaching

### The "Gnat-Z"s approach
Copters appear over the camp/village, and In an attempt to aquire someone alive, they use the genius method of firing randomly at the crowd of people.

During the commotion, Joey is shot, complains about it and gets ejected as a board and pocketed by Robert, who starts hiding in the shadows.

### Reich asks some questions
After landing, Henchmen storm out of the copter, and spots the Old Man. the leader Reich starts asking nicely about a person who went missing decades ago, and while Robert listens in to Reich going into a tangent of why they havent come before, a flashback to where the story starts plays.
When the flashback is over, Reich is finishing up with his tangent about how beraucracy may be slow but never stops, and then threatens the Old Man to tell him where this missing person is.

### Robert appears from the shadows
Realising the Old Man's hallucinations had been correct... for once... that they were looking for him, and not wanting to see the Old Man beaten to a pulp as he had been like a distant creepy uncle to him, Robert appears from the shadows and surrenders to a shitsmirking Reich, while the Old Man cries for him not to do go with them.

### Copters, Thoughts and leaving a mark
In the copter, spirits are high, except for Robert, who has just realised that *maybe* he should have thought things through before just rushing out from hiding behind some open boxes filled with high-tech heavy weaponry and armor...
But before being able to finish the thought, a Henchman announces that they are outside the vaporisation range of the Eradica-Tron Explodinating Device 9600‚Ñ¢, to which Reich replies "Explodinate!" which is proceed by a masssive explosion, turning the camp/village and anything within a 5km radius into a neat half-spherical crater

[Alternative]
...
But before being able to finish the thought, a Henchman announces that his Inventory check is missing the extremely unstable ordnance and it's safety case that someone had written "Shake me" on and giftwrapped as a joke, to which Reich replies "Oh, I must have "accidentally" mistaken it for the usual welcome gift of that cute video with Donkey and Roosters cooling off in the water: "Hot and Wet Asses and Cocks".. Oh well, let's hope they don't take it out and shake it!" or something followed by the huge explosion.
(might require addition of giving a gift in an earlier panel)

Robert snaps in anger and tries to get to Reich, calling him names like Killer, murderer etc. Reich answers by ordering his Henchmen to shut Robert up.
Bruised and swollen from beatings, Robert contemplates his choices

### Crashing the party
It's just after dawn, the copter flies towards a dystopian and polluted city, 
Henchmen shout out various readings and confirmations to Reich's orders, when a Henchman activates the BOEING Descent System* [* other macguffin/contraption/silly reason suggestions welcome!] which proceeds to put the copter in an uncontrollable downwards dive, which takes an inexplicably long time while an excited narrator asks if this is the end of Robert, how can he get out of this mess, and will he get through customs without being stopped, and to tune in RIGHT NOW!

### The black panel of nothingness
We only hear Robert wondering if he will survive yet another copter crash before a crashing sound plays.

## **OPTIONAL STRETCH SCENES**
If we complete all the artwork, we can add the additional scene shown in the Game intro only, where Robert escapes from the wreckage and runs into the factory where the game starts you off.

>[!NOTE]
>This is just a guideline and does not have to be followed to every detail, you are free to make suggestion for changes and interpreted the scene in your own way.
