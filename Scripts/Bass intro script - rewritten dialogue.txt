## Scene 4 - Pampers butting in.

### Scene Description:
Pampers looking at Old Fart

### Pampers - Narration
I had seen the old fart hallucinate high of his rocker over a 100 times, but since he got so pissy when nobody took him seriously, I humored him. 
After all he'd been like some creepy uncle to me, who taught me to make drugs out of fermenting my own dung, how to kill those icky spiders and how to survive in the Gash without my Chameleon_Cat plushy.

### Pampers - Spoken - Not really that bothered or interested.
*Sigh* And what does this evil want here THIS time?
<shut up and sit down Pampers, or he'll...">

## Scene 5 - J'accuse.

### Scene Description:
Ground view looking up,Old Fart pointing at Pampers, Soupey making a racket

### Old Fart
Oh my genetically unrelated dingle-berry, who I found when I was tripping balls on fermented turds in the Gash and thought was a mystic talking sand-goblin in disguise who would grant me a wish if I took care of it, but when I sobered up, turned out to be just a human child who Mrs. Old Fart demanded we adopt...
<Awww>
I fear...
I fear the evil wants YOU!
<"See? what did I tell you!">

### Pampers - Narration
That was when SOUPEY started making noises...

<computer/robot/digital noises>

My sensors, they tingle with zesty tomato delight! I am receiving an incoming audio soup, uhm, audio source.

<"fappa fappa faPPA FAPPA FAPPA FAPPA FAPPA FAPPA FAPPA">
### Old Fart
The evil!

Sounded more to me like the old fart when he's filling his fermentation jars, than something that's *truly* evil, like the creators of Stair Quest...

### Scene Description:
Pampers jumping away from row of bullets fired from copter in background sky, Old Fart, Soupey and villagers running.

### Soupey
Thanks for running away and leaving me behind, Pampers, you soiled diaper brain! 
My next shell better be Foster,<"Error message/beep/chime> I mean faster, and made by someone actually competent.. that means **NOT** by you Pampers...

### Pampers - Narration
He was only a Random PCB I found after digging through some extra spicy sewage.. That turned out to have some sort of sarcastic and megalomaniac computer brain prototype on it, but, well, I did kinda enjoy his salty bisque sarcasm.

As he put band-aids on my boo-boos, the Middle-aged fart had vaguely explained that there was nothing he could do to save the other survivors, and I knew there was no way I'd get back to the city..

Hah!

### Soupey
I am.. ALIVE!
Greetings inferior meatbags, You may call me Soupey, or suffer the consequences.

---

## Scene 24 - And a new name

### Scene Description:
Old Fart holding a Pampers label and pointing like he's posing for a cheesy commercial

### Pampers - Narration
And I was provided with a second name.

### Old Fart
This random piece of trash i just found is what we'll call you, now that you've come of age at your 34th birthday.
I found you, protected you, and taught you to be more absorbent, so that makes you Jerry Pampers.

Harry...

Whatever...

Now, give us the the guy who escaped us over 20 years ago, or we'll shoot everyone.. again, starting with you, you weirdly nameless old git..

### Pampers - Narration
The old fart had been right.. for once.. after making drugged out, hallucinatory predictions every week since he found me.

---

## Scene 26 - Here i am

### Scene Description:
backside of Pampers emerging towards Old Fart, Wichser and henchmen standing in background

### Pampers - Narration
Maybe this wasn't the smartest plan It was obviously me they wanted, but maybe I could...

The RNG scan-o-meter confirminates that it's him commander Wichser.

<SMACK>
---

## Scene 32 - Wait Quest

### Scene Description:
Closeup of Pampers with a swollen black eye and bloody/runny nose

### Pampers - Narration
I was unable to discuss my objections to vaporising the village, and since there wasn't any tea or coffee, or even an in-flight magazine,  all I could do was wait.
Waiting just like the Old Fart taught me, when the batteries to my gameboy had to recharge, 
Wait, Stay focused and be ready...

---

## Scene 34 - the roosterhole

### Scene Description:
Double panel:

First panel: looking straight into cockpit windows from outside, Wichser to the left, a pilot to the right, and Pampers on the floor behind them in middle, Wichser reading a book (Villany for dummies!)

Second panel: same as the first panel, but everyone has a worried look on their face, book and other stuff flying around, shaking.

### Pampers - Narration
Now the Old Fart and the others were reduced to nothing more than a neatly filled checkbox on one of Wichsers many forms.

### Henchman
Affirmative commander whiskers.. err Commander Wichser. 
Approaching Security Quadrant Headquarters now, actimavating the BOEING descent system now.

### Pampers - Narration
But what was I supposed to... Why did they... 
Wait, what did he say that landing system was called...(interrupted)

### Wichser - shocked
BOEING??

### Henchman 
An ancient manufacturer of something called air planes commander Wichser,[*] but that's not important right now, the BOEING descent system... it's taken over all controls!

[*] Wichser: "what's an air plane?" Henchman: an air plane is a tool for planing air"  and so on and so on, (can be a fun place to add cameos or something?)
---

## Scene 35 - Black Hawk-Thua Down

### Scene Description:
Copter plummeting down towards city, camera zooms veeery slowly in
<annoying alarm/beeping/warning>

### Pilot - low, calm, half mumbling, mic close to mouth / audio clipping [I'll adapt the audio volume so it is about the same volume as other voices)
<crackle>
This is the captain speaking, as you can see out your windows if you tilt your heads, it's a lovely day, smoggy, with only the occasional acid drizzle.
We will soon be landing.. somewhere on the ground, the outside temperature is a crisp 14 degrees Celsius, or 57 Fahrenheit, or 287 point 2 Kelvin, or 420 point 69 Varmeme units...

(Sudden stop with freezeframe, hammy voice over saying something like: 
"Is this the end of Harry Pampers? Will Soupey ever fulfil his hard-coded wish to take over the world? To find out, tune in... ...RIGHT NOW!
...continues playing from Freezeframe)

...or 1337 point 47 on the Keith scale.

we *might* experience some *minor* turbulence so please return to your seats, fold up that flimsy little tray, fasten your seatbelts and pray to whatever deity you believe in, and those you don't believe in.
Smoke'em if you got them, and thank you for choosing to fly with VillAir®, the Villains choice.

### Pampers - Narration
<seatbelt click sound>
Maybe I'd get some answers now..
[Cut to black and silence]
[That is... as long as I don't get stuck in Customs.. or worse, in some kind of fair and balanced retrospective...]
<Crashing copter sound>
