## Scene 4 - Pampers butting in.

### Scene Description:
Tampax looking at Old Fart

### Tampax - Narration
I had seen the old fart high of his rocker over a 100 times, but since he got so pissy when nobody took him seriously, I humored him. 
After all he'd been like a creepy uncle to me, who taught me to make drugs out of fermenting my own dung, how to kill those icky spiders and how to survive in the Gash without my Chameleon_Cat plushy.

### Tampax - Spoken - Not really that bothered or interested.
*Sigh* And what does this evil want here THIS time?
<shut up and sit down Pampers, or he'll...">

Ground view looking up,Old Fart pointing at Tampax,Soupey pointing

### Old Fart
Oh my genetically unrelated dingle-berry, who i found when i was tripping balls on fermented turds in the Gash and thought was a mystic sand-goblin who would grant me a wish if I took care of it, but when i sobered up, turned out to be just a human child who mrs. Old Fart demanded we adopted...
<Awww>
I fear...
I fear the evil wants YOU!
<"See? told you!">

### Tampax - Narration

We will be landing shortly and *might* experience some *minor* turbulence so please return to your seats, fold up that flimsy little tray, fasten your seatbelts and pray to whatever deity you believe in, and those you don't believe in.
