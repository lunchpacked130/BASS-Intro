# Welcome to the madjyckal world of Voiceover...ing.

## How does this work?

Ive done my best to make a 5 step guide to how contributing Voiceover recordings for this project will work below.

>[!NOTE]
>If you are unsure about your contribution or the rules etc, you can ask in the #🎨Artography channel on the SQH Discord, remember to mention/tag @changisss
> 
>As there are much less Voiceover Roles than there are Artworks,
>All Voiceover contributions will be reviewed.
>In the case where one or more Character role(s) recieve more than one contribution, a vote will be held.

Please 
If you have absolutely no experience doing any sort of vocal work, or the vocal work you have done is only for private use or friends/family.

If you are or have been a published* voiceover artist (*= you have contributed your voice for a game/video etc that has been or is is/was going to be published,
  Or if you are a content creator who use their own voice (streamer/youtuber/podcaster etc), or you have experience doing similar vocal work or other speaking roles like acting/presentatios/lecturing/etc.
By all means ***DO*** record and submit a contribution, but please also mark your assignment and files with (EXP)
This 


1) Check the [Current Progression Tracker]() or the [Discussion Forums]()
2) Prioritize choosing unassigned Character roles over Character roles being worked on and both over completed recordings unless all roles are completed.
3) When you have chosen your Character Role to voice, create a thread in the [Discussion Forums]() detailing which role you have chosen.
4) Record the lines for the character role you chose, preferably recorded in a single session. (see tip section below)
5) Submit your contribution for review as a single audio file in either lossless WAV or MP3 or M4A recorded at Minimum 192kbps cbr / 248kbps vbr @ 48khz.

If the size is too big for Github, or you dont want your raw recording to be public, please send a DM to @changisss on Discord requesting an upload share.
You will then be provided with a link and password with 48hours access to a privately shared upload folder on my OneDrive

>[!NOTE]
>Please do not edit or cut the recording session or record each line seperately and edit them together, as any cuts, edits, noise cancellation etc. will be done during the editing process when the projecreadyclose to being ready for completion.
>This also means you should leave any errors/flubs/bloopers/etc in the contribution recording, and I might use them for the credits sequence or a seperate "blooper-reel" segment after the credits.
>You can opt-out of having your errors/flubs/bloopers/etc used in the video by marking your contribution with OPT-OUT.
>However... before opting out, i do encourage you to atleast think it over one more time, my goal isn't to ridicule or anything like that, it's for spreading fun and laughter by showing that nobody's perfect,
>Should you still decide to opt-out, it's totally understandable and there are absolutely ***no*** hard feelings or any sort of "lesser chance to be considered" or stuff like that :) Your contribution(s) is more than enough! ❤️

>[!WARNING]
>Scripts thay are not yet finalized are subject to change until marked as finalized.
>If Voiceover is contributed before scripts are Finalized, please be available for potentially recording any changed/new dialogue if the script for your assigned Character role has been updated when finalized.

>[!Note]
> If you have contributed a finalized voiceover, you might still be requested to re-record one or more lines.
> This will typically happen if there is noises we cant remove, it's hard to hear clearly what is said or similar audio issues we are unable to rectify.
> You might also get requests to re-record lines differently or other suggestions that we think will improve your contribution even further.
> (All such requests are based on your Voiceover contribution(s) and will more or less be just minor changes, for example changing the pace, emphasising or un-emphasising words, etc.
>  nothing advanced like performing the voiceover in a specific accent or mimic another voice type etc.)
> A thorough explanation will*Always* be given for any re-recording requests.
