# SQH Community Re-Creation: 
## *Beneath a Steel Sky* Intro

This is a collaborative, open-source effort to reimagine the gritty, dystopian opening sequence through **artwork**, **voice acting**, and **creative reinterpretation**. Whether you’re a seasoned illustrator, a voice actor with a home mic, or someone who’s never drawn a line or recorded a word — you belong here.

## 🧠 “But I’m Not Creative…”

This project is **especially** for people who think they’re “not creative,” “can’t draw,” “don’t have a good voice,” or “would just mess it up.” If you’ve ever felt that way — congratulations, you’re exactly who we want.

- Can’t draw? try drawing anyway, physically on paper or digitally on Microsoft Paint or similar
- Can’t voice act? Read a line in your own voice. Use your phone mic, just please avoid recording in noisy environments if possible.
- Not sure what to contribute? Even feedback, ideas, or jokes help shape the tone.
- Want to contribute but don't want any name credits? no problem, mark it as an anonymous contribution, submit with an anonymous account, or contact me on discord directly (i will keep your username confidential) or relayed through someone you trust.
- While we welcome any skill level or lack thereof, don't feel intimidated or think something like *"I could never do anything half as good as that anyway, so why even try?"*, give it your best shot anyway, just have fun with it.

The amazing Chameleon_Cat has even provided us with some amazing artwork guidelines for how the panels are structured to help with drawing

Creativity isn’t a skill — it’s a spirit. And this project thrives on **spirit** (and other substances😎).

## 📜 Contribution Rules

Feel free to interpret the artwork and voiceover however you see fit, as long as you follow these simple rules:

- **⛔️ Absolutely NO AI or generative use!**
  no image generators, no text to speech, only non-machine-made contributions will be accepted. 

- **🔞 No 18+ NSFW content**  
  That means no nudity, ultra-violence, realistic gore, or excessive swearing. Let’s keep it *somewhat* family-friendly. Cartoonish violence (think Tom & Jerry) is totally fine.

- **🧵 Use the Discussion Forum**  
  For each artwork or voiceover contribution, create a new thread in the Discussions tab. Title it with the **scene number** and/or **character name** so we can keep things organized.

- **🔁 Duplicates Are Allowed**  
  Multiple versions of the same scene or character are welcome! But please prioritize any **unstarted** ones first — we want full coverage before remixing.

- ** :) No "low-effort" work**
  Simply said, please no 1 minute stickman drawing etc. take your time crafting the best you can do, dont worry about any skill or lack of it, just give it an honest try.

- **🎉 Having Fun Is Mandatory**  
  Seriously. If you’re not having fun, you’re doing it wrong. This is a playground.

## 🚀 How to Join

Open a discussion thread detailing the scene number or character voiceover you want to do.
you can use the thread for a public worklog or notepad or whatever you want, it's your playground of you wish to use it. but as pointed out, anything posted can be viewed by anyone accessing the github. (though i suspect that will mostly be SQH Discord denizens)
